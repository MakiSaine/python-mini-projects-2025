# Python Mini Projects 2025

This repository contains a small collection of Python projects I have developed to practice logical thinking, problem solving, and programming structure.  
Each script can run directly in the terminal and shows how core programming concepts can be combined to create working applications.  
Although some of these started as course exercises, they have been written and structured independently with the goal of building useful, working examples that can be tested by anyone.

## About the Project
The goal of this project was to explore how programming logic and object-oriented thinking can be applied in small, simple programs that still have structure and real functionality.  
Each script focuses on a specific area of Python, such as file handling, data validation, loops, and user interaction.  
Together they show the process of learning how to write clear and reusable code while understanding the importance of testing and debugging.

## Projects Included

### Guess Game
A simple word guessing game that selects a random word from a text file and lets the user guess one letter at a time.  
It keeps track of correct and wrong guesses, shows progress after each attempt, and ends when the player finds the word or runs out of chances.  
This small project demonstrates how to work with files, random values, loops, and conditions.  

**Files:** `guess_game.py` and `words.txt`

### Library Management System
A program built to simulate a basic digital library.  
It allows users to add and remove books, check them in and out, and view the full collection.  
This project focuses on object-oriented programming using two main classes: `Book` and `Library`.  
It shows how classes, attributes, and methods can be used to manage data in a structured way.

**Files:** `library.py` and `library_script.py`

### Bank Account Simulator
This console program lets a user open an account, deposit and withdraw money, and calculate interest.  
It also shows the importance of input validation and exception handling, making it a good example of user interaction in a loop-based system.  
Each option is presented through a simple text-based menu.

**File:** `bank.py`

---

### Palindrome Checker
A short program that checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome.  
It removes spaces and punctuation before comparison and tells the user if the text reads the same backward and forward.  
This project highlights simple string manipulation and logic flow.

**File:** `palindrome.py`

## Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `guess_game.py` | Word guessing game |
| `words.txt` | List of words for the guessing game |
| `library.py` | Class definitions for the library system |
| `library_script.py` | Example script using the library classes |

## How to Run
You can run any of the scripts directly in your terminal.  
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

```bash
python guess_game.py
python library_script.py
python bank.py
python palindrome.py
